## Project Overview
The project addresses the challenges in forecasting economic variables like GDP, inflation, and employment rates using machine learning models. Traditional econometric models often fail to capture complex patterns in economic data. This project demonstrates that machine learning can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of economic forecasting.

## Objectives
1. Identify relevant economic data sources and develop a data collection plan.
2. Evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms for economic forecasting.
3. Explore the relationships between various economic variables such as GDP and inflation.
4. Develop forecasts for economic variables using machine learning techniques.
5. Demonstrate the potential use of these techniques for policy-making decisions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Economic data were collected from sources such as the World Bank, including historical data on GDP, inflation, and stock market indices.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and feature engineering were performed to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and ARIMA were trained on the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluation**: Models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5. **Forecasting**: The models were used to generate forecasts for key economic indicators.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, PyTorch
- **ML Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA, SARIMA
- **Data Sources**: World Bank, Yahoo Finance

## Results
- The project successfully demonstrated the use of machine learning techniques for economic forecasting.
- Random Forest and Time Series models provided the highest accuracy in predicting economic variables.
- The comparison of models highlighted the importance of feature selection and data preprocessing in forecasting accuracy.

## Conclusion
Machine learning techniques offer a promising alternative to traditional econometric models for economic forecasting. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this project provides valuable insights into the dynamics of micro and macroeconomic factors and their impact on a country's economy.
